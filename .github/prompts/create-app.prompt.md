Add the infrastructure for a new app called "<app-name>" for the "<platform>" platform.
Take an existing app for the same platform as an example, but do not add any business logic yetâ€”just the necessary boilerplate and wiring.
Update all relevant files (such as apps.ts, containers, and routing) to register the new app and ensure it builds and runs like the other apps for this platform.
